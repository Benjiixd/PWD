window is a web component that other web components are based of, i could theoreticly create the web components inside anything, but since
they are extended of the window component, they get put in the window-content div. This way icould just focus on the functionality of the 
components.

The window component checks to see if the user holds down on the header, if they do it turns on a active flag, that allows you to move it around
I haven't got around to fixing so i cant move it out of screen yet though.
