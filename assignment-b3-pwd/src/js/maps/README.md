The maps web component is very simple.

It starts of by asking for the users location, when told yes it will then ask the bing api for a image of the map of those cordinates.

After that it will wait for the submit button to be pressed, and then it will use the text input to get a image of the map from bing maps

If it cant find the location, a very bad looking error message not created by me will appear

And it's as simple as that
